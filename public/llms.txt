# Wyckoff Pro - Advanced Volume Spread Analysis Indicator

> The most advanced Wyckoff Method indicator for TradingView. Professional-grade tools to detect institutional accumulation and distribution phases.

## About Wyckoff Pro

Wyckoff Pro is a professional trading indicator built on the principles of Richard D. Wyckoff, a legendary Wall Street trader and technical analyst from the early 20th century. Our indicator helps traders identify:

- **Accumulation Phases**: Periods where institutional investors are quietly buying assets before a markup phase
- **Distribution Phases**: Periods where institutions are selling their positions before a markdown
- **Volume Spread Analysis (VSA)**: Advanced analysis of the relationship between price spread and volume
- **Smart Money Footprints**: Identifying when large players are entering or exiting positions

## The Wyckoff Method

Richard Wyckoff developed his trading methodology in the 1930s, focusing on:

1. **The Law of Supply and Demand**: Price movements are driven by the imbalance between buying and selling pressure
2. **The Law of Cause and Effect**: Accumulation and distribution create the "cause" for subsequent price movements
3. **The Law of Effort vs Result**: Volume (effort) should confirm price movement (result)
